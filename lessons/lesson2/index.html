          Why I think the website I chose illustrates the principle is, it
          includes the principles of design because principles of design include
          balance, emphasis, white space, proportion, hierarchy, repetition,
          parttern alignment, color, and variety. These principles of design
          work together to create something that is pleasing and optimise for
          user experience. Again, it include the general rules for the design of
          web-base media that layout and interact with the design. For instance;
          it bring out the entire experience from the moment users enter the
          site. It display and deliver the features and the content openly.
