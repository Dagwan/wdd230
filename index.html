          Why are grids or flex useful in web design? The interesting thing
          to know about sites with 3 column contents and Why grids or flex matter in web
          design is that they help give shape and hierarchy to our web design pages. Without
          them, we would have no idea where to place our pages or design elements. We
          need them to create a good user experience so our user knows how to
          navigate through our website and find what they need. It is a good practice for us to always put
          our pages in a tide way so they can continue to give our client the better experience
          they would expect from us.
